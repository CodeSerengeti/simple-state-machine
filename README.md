# simple-state-machine
A simple state machine for Spring Boot projects

After importing into STS can be run as Spring Boot application.

The following two APIs are supported:

http://localhost:8080/order/submit

http://localhost:8080/order/pay?payment=123&orderId=123

(for quick testing in a browser both of the above are GET APIs)
